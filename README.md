## Features
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Imported data from a CSV file.
   - Identified and imputed missing values using column means.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Descriptive statistics for numerical variables.
   - Visualizations:
     - Histogram for stay duration.
     - Bar chart and pie chart for property type distribution.
     - Boxplot for price per night by property type.
     - Heatmap for correlation between numerical variables.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - ANOVA: Analyzed revenue differences across property types.
   - Chi-Square Test: Investigated relationships between property type and revenue category.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Linear Regression: Predicted total revenue using price per night and occupancy rate.
   - Logistic Regression: Modeled occupancy rate based on price, customer rating, and discount.
